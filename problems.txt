1. I am using next-auth for authentication and authorization it turns out that next-auth updated thier package and it broke my code, it took me some time to read through thier documentation to figure the problem out.
2. In server side rendering if there is a problem with the api the page may not load because of the error, in my case now I am trying to navigate to the /orders page but because the model for Orders is not yet registered in the Schema the page is not loading.
