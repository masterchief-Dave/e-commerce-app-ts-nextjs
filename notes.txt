1. one of the issues i am facing is i am making use of express api even when i am using next api, 
- one of the reasons is because i cannot make use of local server in server side props, which means i had to deploy the api  
- the reason i am making use of next auth is because of the session management is fantastic, however because of that i cannot protect routes in my express api routes because the token sent from the client to the server cannot be decoded on the server.
