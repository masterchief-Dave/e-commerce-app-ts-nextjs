1. one of the issues i am facing is i am making use of express api even when i am using next api, 
- one of the reasons is because i cannot make use of local server in server side props, which means i had to deploy the api  
- the reason i am making use of next auth is because of the session management is fantastic, however because of that i cannot protect routes in my express api routes because the token sent from the client to the server cannot be decoded on the server.
- 


window[WINDOW_USER_SCRIPT_VARIABLE] = data

ISSUES I AM FACING
I Noticed that in the /cart page, the page is loading, which does not really make sense because it is not necessarily a protected page,
I also noticed that the faq page and  the legal pages were doing the same thing, which is loading to check if the user is present,

SOLUTION
1. the initial solution that came to me is that I should wrap in the layout the components that needs the user auth and not use the wrapping in my _app.tsx file
by doing this the pages that don't need user authentication will not have a problem

ANOTHER ISSUE
2. With my current implementation, I cannot make use of server side props because, I cannot get the Authorization header which is not present inside the server req header
